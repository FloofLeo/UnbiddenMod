# Unbidden

You've destroyed Golem, you've assaulted the Lunatic Cultist, halted the Lunar events, and destroyed the Moon Lord, the Destroyer of Worlds. Now what? Do you just sit back and enjoy your boundless power as if nothing happened?

Hells no! You've got a lot left to do. Moon Lord was only the beginning. The calamities you've faced, the hells you've endured, it's only the tip of the iceberg. The cosmos had reared its ugly head for but a moment, and you were nearly obliterated. Impossible odds are against you now as not only the cosmos, but beyond, in the Aether, face you in full and bring its worst down upon you. You're nearing your journey's end. The true question is:

**_Are you ready?_**

This is the source-code for the UnbiddenMod project; A mod for Terraria via tModLoader.

## Unbidden Mod

A large-scale project planned to be an overhaul mod for Terraria. It delves into the deeper mechanics of Terraria while adding its own flares, big and small. We have several mechanics implemented right now (Elements, Auras, Parries, etc), as well as a new class called a Cleric, and we have big plans for future additions the scale of which you've most likely seen in other big Terraria mods. It's a passion project and so far our very small community of people have been helping us better our mod bit by bit with new content suggestions and other tidbits here and there. While we might just be starting off, there is a lot of promise and potential in our mod so far, and we are a dedicated team of Devs working on making the dream a reality.
